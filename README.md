Image captioning is a challenging task that involves generating textual descriptions for images. 
This task requires understanding the content of an image and effectively translating it into a 
coherent and descriptive sentence. Combining the capabilities of convolutional neural networks 
(CNNs) for image feature extraction and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequence 
generation, this project aims to develop a robust model for automatic image captioning.
